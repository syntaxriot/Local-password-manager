## Features

- 🔐 Military-grade encryption using Fernet (AES-128-CBC)
- 🛡️ PBKDF2 key derivation with 480,000 iterations
- 📁 Local storage in encrypted JSON format
- 🔑 Master password protection
- ➕ Add new credentials
- 🔍 Retrieve stored passwords
- 📋 List all stored services
- 🚫 No internet connection required
- 📦 Self-contained single-file solution

## Installation

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.7+
   - cryptography library

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

3. **Download**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/local-password-manager.git
   cd local-password-manager
   ```

## Usage

```bash
python password_manager.py
```

**First Run Setup**:
1. Create a strong master password
2. Confirm master password
3. Your encrypted vault will be created

**Main Menu**:
```
1. Store new password
2. Retrieve password
3. List all services
4. Exit
```

### Storing Credentials
- Service name (e.g., "GitHub")
- Username/Email
- Password (hidden input)

### Retrieving Passwords
- Search by service name
- Decrypted passwords displayed temporarily

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- Master password never stored
- Unique 16-byte salt generated per vault
- Key derivation parameters:
  - PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
  - 480,000 iterations
- Encrypted elements:
  - Verification token
  - All stored passwords

### File Structure (passwords.json)
```json
{
  "salt": "BASE64_ENCODED_SALT",
  "verification": "ENCRYPTED_VERIFICATION_TOKEN",
  "entries": [
    {
      "service": "Plaintext service name",
      "username": "Plaintext username",
      "password": "Encrypted password"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Limitations

- 🔄 No cloud sync/backup functionality
- 📁 Local file security depends on system security
- 🔑 Master password recovery not possible
- ⚠️ Always maintain backups of passwords.json
